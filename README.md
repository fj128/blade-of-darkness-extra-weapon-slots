# Blade of Darkness: extra weapon slots.

This removes the annoying mechanic from "Blade of Darkness" where sometimes there's not enough weapon slots and you have to choose between discarding a still useful weapon and not taking a weapon that will become useful in the future. A few extra weapon slots (8 total in this case) completely eliminate this headache.

It lifts the restriction after you saved and loaded the game once. I have not yet tested it with the sword of Ianna interaction yet, but it should work.

Clone into your BoD directory. If someone adds instructions for applying `git format-patch` resulting patch it would be welcome.

I'm using the GOG new version.
